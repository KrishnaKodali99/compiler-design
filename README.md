## Introduction

This repository contains assignments related to the design and development of compilers. The goal is to provide practical experience with various stages of the compiler construction process, including lexical analysis, syntax parsing, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.

## Assignments Overview

### 1. **Lexical Analysis**
   - Task: Develop a lexical analyzer for a given language.
   - Tools: Flex, Lex, or custom implementation.

### 2. **Syntax Analysis**
   - Task: Implement a syntax analyzer using parsing techniques like LL(1), LR(1), or SLR(1).
   - Tools: Yacc, Bison, or custom implementation.

### 3. **Semantic Analysis**
   - Task: Perform semantic checks and generate abstract syntax trees (ASTs).
   - Focus: Type checking, variable scope resolution.

### 4. **Code Generation**
   - Task: Implement a basic code generator that translates high-level language code to assembly or intermediate code.

### 5. **Optimization**
   - Task: Apply optimization techniques such as constant folding and dead code elimination.

## Requirements

- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Tools & Libraries:** Flex, Yacc, etc.
- **Operating Systems:** Linux

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
